  Your app manages online gift cards for a soon-to-be-major e-tailer.
  Customers can use the app to place orders using their card
  balance. <br /><br />

  We have classes that model the GiftCard and the Customer.  First you
  will write tests for the GiftCard class, to verify that: <br /><br />

  * a GiftCard when first created has a non-negative cash balance <br />
  * a withdrawal when there is enough cash returns success, and changes 
  the card balance <br />
  * a withdrawal when there is not enough cash returns failure, provides 
  an error message explaining the failure, and does not change the card balance. <br />

        expect { GiftCard.new(-1) }.to raise_error(?ArgumentError?)

      it 'succeeds with positive balance' do
        gift_card = GiftCard.new(20)
        ?expect?(gift_card.balance).to ?eq?(20)
