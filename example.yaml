  This is an example question. Write a test for the even function. 
common: app/ # this is the directory to a completed app, this will go into suites/common/
submit_to: app/spec/func_spec.rb # this is where _submission_file will append to when running suites
solution: | # this is the code which will be FPP-ed by Logan's script and have all questionmarks removed for _submission_file
  describe functions do
    it "Even function" do
      ?expect(even(1)).to eq False?
      ?expect(even(2)).to eq True?
